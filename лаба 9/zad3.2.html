            <h3>HTML5</h3>
            HTML5 is a revision of the HTML standard. It’s a massive improvement over HTML4 because HTML4 did not allow
            web developers to add features to their sites that were not HTML-supported. To do so required the use of
            proprietary technologies and the installation of browser plugins.

            Subsequently, if web users did not have a device that supported the use of those proprietary technologies or
            plugins either, then they could not access the content. An example is how Safari on mobile Apple devices
            does not support the use of Adobe Flash.

            The main purpose behind HTML5 was to remove the need for proprietary technologies and plugins. You can
            create offline applications, and include multimedia animations, interactive flipbooks, audio, and video into
            your web pages without needing to download extra plugins to include said applications or multimedia.

            <h3>CSS3</h3>
            Web designers and developers use CSS3 and HTML to build and modify content on a web page. CSS lets you
            choose from different typographies, images, colors, tables, and much more to stylize a web page in a way
            that’s intuitive for users and aesthetically pleasing.

            Without CSS, we wouldn’t have any way to position different elements on a web page — CSS lets you use values
            like ‘fixed’ and ‘absolute’ to position a web page’s visual components.

            CSS3 is simply the updated version of an earlier version of CSS (CSS2). It has many important improvements
            and features that help improve your web presence and are now being utilized in modern browsers, including:

            Allowing third-party videos to be viewed without the installation of third-party plugins
            Making it easier to install graphics on a web page
            Allowing the presentation of content in multiple columns
            Enabling a precise positioning of all navigable elements in a web page
            Adjusting the white space of a document

            <h2>Why is CSS major for web design?</h2>
            CSS3 makes it viable to create web pages that are interactive and highly responsive. CSS3 is often lauded for the many
            options it provides web designers who need to make their online pages enjoyable to use. After all, if a customer is
            checking out products and services that a web page is advertising, the presentation of those products and services
            should be visually appealing — that’s where CSS comes in.
